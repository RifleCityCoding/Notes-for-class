# Bootstrap

### A common APP that helps provide easy framework for websites. 

### Bootstrap containers
Containers are used to pad the content inside of them and there are two classes available

The container class provides a responsive fixed width container

The container fluid class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport

By default, containers have left and right padding, with no top or bottom padding. You can add "spacing utilities" such as extra padding and margins to make them look even better. Example: <div class='container pt-5'>pt-5 is to add a large top padding </div>
